# Tags

Tags are text labels which can be applied to objects. Each tag has a label and
a URL-friendly slug. The slug is generated automatically and makes tags easier
to work with as URL parameters. Objects can be filtered by tags.

For each tag that you create, the following properties are to be provided (some
are however optional):

  * `Name`: a human readable name attached to a tag.
  * `Slug`: a unique configuration and URL friendly name; most of the time it
    is automatically generated from the tag's name.
  * `Color`: a RGB color code that will be used when displaying the tag in the
    user interface.
  * `Comments`: some text that can be formatted in Markdown to explain what the
    tag is for or to use for any other purposes.
